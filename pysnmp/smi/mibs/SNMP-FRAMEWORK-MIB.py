    An octet string containing administrative information, preferably in human-
    readable form. To facilitate internationalization, this information is
    represented using the ISO/IEC IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
    string using the UTF-8 transformation format described in [RFC2279]. Since
    additional code points are added by amendments to the 10646 standard from time
    to time, implementations must be prepared to encounter any code point from
    0x00000000 to 0x7fffffff. Byte sequences that do not correspond to the valid
    UTF-8 encoding of a code point or are outside this range are prohibited. The
    use of control codes should be avoided. When it is necessary to represent a
    newline, the control code sequence CR LF should be used. The use of leading or
    trailing white space should be avoided. For code points not directly supported
    by user interface hardware or software, an alternative means of entry and
    display, such as hexadecimal, may be provided. For information encoded in 7-bit
    US-ASCII, the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the US-ASCII encoding. UTF-8 may
    require multiple bytes to represent a single character / code point; thus the
    length of this object in octets may be different from the number of characters
    encoded. Similarly, size constraints refer to the number of encoded octets, not
    the number of characters represented by an encoding. Note that when this TC is
    used for an object that is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then a
    SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the number of sub-identifiers for
    any object instance does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by [RFC3416].
    Note that the size of an SnmpAdminString object is measured in octets, not
    characters.

    An SNMP engine's administratively-unique identifier. Objects of this type are
    for identification, not for addressing, even though it is possible that an
    address may have been used in the generation of a specific value. The value for
    this object may not be all zeros or all 'ff'H or the empty (zero length)
    string. The initial value for this object may be configured via an operator
    console entry or via an algorithmic function. In the latter case, the following
    example algorithm is recommended. In cases where there are multiple engines on
    the same system, the use of this algorithm is NOT appropriate, as it would
    result in all of those engines ending up with the same ID value. 1) The very
    first bit is used to indicate how the rest of the data is composed. 0 - as
    defined by enterprise using former methods that existed before SNMPv3. See item
    2 below. 1 - as defined by this architecture, see item 3 below. Note that this
    allows existing uses of the engineID (also known as AgentID [RFC1910]) to co-
    exist with any new uses. 2) The snmpEngineID has a length of 12 octets. The
    first four octets are set to the binary equivalent of the agent's SNMP
    management private enterprise number as assigned by the Internet Assigned
    Numbers Authority (IANA). For example, if Acme Networks has been assigned {
    enterprises 696 }, the first four octets would be assigned '000002b8'H. The
    remaining eight octets are determined via one or more enterprise-specific
    methods. Such methods must be designed so as to maximize the possibility that
    the value of this object will be unique in the agent's administrative domain.
    For example, it may be the IP address of the SNMP entity, or the MAC address of
    one of the interfaces, with each address suitably padded with random octets. If
    multiple methods are defined, then it is recommended that the first octet
    indicate the method being used and the remaining octets be a function of the
    method. 3) The length of the octet string varies. The first four octets are set
    to the binary equivalent of the agent's SNMP management private enterprise
    number as assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For
    example, if Acme Networks has been assigned { enterprises 696 }, the first four
    octets would be assigned '000002b8'H. The very first bit is set to 1. For
    example, the above value for Acme Networks now changes to be '800002b8'H. The
    fifth octet indicates how the rest (6th and following octets) are formatted.
    The values for the fifth octet are: 0 - reserved, unused. 1 - IPv4 address (4
    octets) lowest non-special IP address 2 - IPv6 address (16 octets) lowest non-
    special IP address 3 - MAC address (6 octets) lowest IEEE MAC address,
    canonical order 4 - Text, administratively assigned Maximum remaining length 27
