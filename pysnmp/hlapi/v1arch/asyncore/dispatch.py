    `SnmpDispatcher` object manages send and receives SNMP PDU
    messages through underlying transport dispatcher and dispatches
    them to the callers.

    `SnmpDispatcher` is the only stateful object, all `hlapi.v1arch` SNMP
    operations require an instance of `SnmpDispatcher`. Users do not normally
    request services directly from `SnmpDispather`, but pass it around to
    other `hlapi.v1arch` interfaces.

    It is possible to run multiple instances of `SnmpDispatcher` in the
    application. In a multithreaded environment, each thread that
    works with SNMP must have its own `SnmpDispatcher` instance.
